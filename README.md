<h2>If You Are HWID Banned</h2>
<p>Valorant is known for issuing HWID bans through its Vanguard anti-cheat system. If you’ve been hardware banned, an IP change alone won’t help — you'll need to follow this separate guide focused on spoofing your hardware ID.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Valorant bans are handled by Riot Vanguard and can involve IP bans, HWID bans, and account chain bans depending on the severity of the offense.</li>
    <li>This guide focuses on IP bans, which are sometimes issued for things like smurfing, boosting, cheating, or toxicity — especially after reports.</li>
    <li>You’ll need to combine an IP address change with clearing identifiers and avoiding linkbacks to banned accounts, launchers, or settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Method: Mandatory Steps to Bypass IP Bans</h2>
<p>Follow these steps in order to effectively bypass a Valorant IP ban. Each step ensures you're appearing as a completely fresh user on Riot's radar.</p>

<h3>1. Changing Your IP Address</h3>
<p>This is the first and most important step. Riot uses your IP to flag repeated offenses or linked accounts. You can use a VPN, proxy, or change your home network IP manually.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Using a VPN:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For PC:</strong> Use a trusted, paid VPN that doesn’t leak DNS or WebRTC data. Free VPNs are often blocked by Riot. Once installed, connect to a different server and verify your IP has changed using an IP checker before launching Valorant.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Using a Proxy:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For PC:</strong> Set up a private SOCKS5 or residential proxy in your network settings. Test that your connection routes properly before attempting to log in.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Switching Network:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For PC:</strong> You can also try tethering from your mobile data or switching Wi-Fi networks to get a new IP from your ISP.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Valorant’s Vanguard anti-cheat system can sometimes detect popular VPN IP ranges. Use providers that offer residential or undetectable IP pools.</p>

<h3>2. Clearing Cache and Cookies</h3>
<p>If you’ve used Riot’s website or logged into your Riot account from a browser, cookie data can reveal your identity. Clear everything.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Open browser settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data.</li>
            <li>Select “Cookies and other site data” and “Cached images and files.”</li>
            <li>Clear all and restart your browser.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Riot’s login sessions and browser tokens may persist between logins if not cleared, so don’t skip this.</p>

<h3>3. Uninstalling and Reinstalling</h3>
<p>Reinstalling both the Riot client and Valorant ensures that local config files or cached accounts are removed.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Uninstall Riot Vanguard, Riot Client, and Valorant completely.</li>
            <li>Navigate to <code>C:\Program Files\Riot Games</code> and delete leftover folders.</li>
            <li>Use the official Riot installer to redownload everything after changing your IP.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Don’t log into the same banned account. Create a fresh Riot ID and don’t reuse your previous in-game name or linked email.</p>

<h3>4. Changing MAC Address</h3>
<p>Riot may flag your MAC address if bans have occurred from the same machine multiple times. Spoofing it gives you a clean slate.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Change adapter options.</li>
            <li>Right-click your adapter > Properties > Configure > Advanced tab.</li>
            <li>Locate “Network Address” or “MAC Address”, enter a new value, and restart your PC.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use a MAC address generator online to avoid repeating values. Combine this with a new IP for best results.</p>

<h2>How It Works Together</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hides your IP from Riot’s blacklist.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Prevents browser data from linking you back to the old account/IP.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Wipes Riot and Valorant files that could track or relink you.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Ensures your hardware signature is different from before.</li>
</ul>
<p>This all combines to make you look like a completely new player to Riot’s systems — but you still need to be careful once you’re back in.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Create a fresh Riot account with a new email, and don’t reuse old usernames or payment methods.</li>
    <li>Use a different PC user profile if possible, or reset your Windows SID for deeper spoofing.</li>
    <li>Stick to legit clients and avoid triggering Vanguard again — another ban might be permanent.</li>
    <li>Avoid logging into old banned accounts, even briefly — it can re-flag your machine.</li>
    <li>Don’t rush back into ranked or play suspiciously right away. Keep a low profile for a few days.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method ensures a clean re-entry into Valorant, without triggering Riot’s anti-cheat or detection systems again. Stay smart and low-key, and you’ll be back on the server in no time.</p>
